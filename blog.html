        <p>
          I've been learning to code since May 2022. I decided to start keeping a blog about my journey into web development and programming in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my immediate goal is to get a job as a front-end web developer, I want to keep pursuing programming and computer science
          to see where it will get me. I'm also interested in game development, artificical intelligence and machine learning, amd quantum
          computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admittedly though, computers and programming, while fascinating, are not my major passions. I've always wanted to be a writer
          first and foremost, and I spent most of my free-time writing or reading canonical literary works so that I can hopefully one day
          push the forms of imaginative literature.
