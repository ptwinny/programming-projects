          This is my first post. Right now I've got about eight or nine months exprience with programming languages. I started with C, then moved on to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I feel ready to start looking for my first job.
        </p>

          I've spent most of my time lately on my portfolio site. My portfolio's theme is based on the Persona 4 Golden video game. There was no intention for basing the theme on the game other than I liked how the opening movie and start screen looked, and I decided it would be fun to recreate it as a webpage. Obviously it isn't as well done or animated as the video game, but I did have fun designing and animating the logo, which looks like this:
        </p>
          [add logo HTML, CSS, and JS here]
        <p>
          As well as animating the "sticky" navigation bar here:
        </p>
        <p>
          I've decided to concentrate on these two languages in particular, using JavaScript when it makes sense. But I hope to get an initial job by concentrating on the former two. And once I get really good at them then I'll concentrate more on developing my JavaScript skills. And of course, I'll work on JavaScript whenever I need it for my own projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other thing I'm working on, obviously, is this blog. I confess I'm doing this more because I hope it will help me get a job more than anything, but there are obvious benefits from keeping a record of one's activities in whatever field they're interested in. If anything it'll be proof of one's progress. It also gives me an opportunity to reflect and be grateful for working hard at this.

        <p>
          I've been learning to code since May 2022. I decided to start keeping a blog about my journey into web development and programming in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my immediate goal is to get a job as a front-end web developer, I want to keep pursuing programming and computer science
          to see where it will get me. I'm also interested in game development, artificical intelligence and machine learning, amd quantum
          computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admittedly though, computers and programming, while fascinating, are not my major passions. I've always wanted to be a writer
          first and foremost, and I spent most of my free-time writing or reading canonical literary works so that I can hopefully one day
          push the forms of imaginative literature.
