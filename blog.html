          Hello, good reader! This is the first post on my developer blog. Right now I've got about eight or nine months experience 
          with programming languages. I started with C, then moved on to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the intention of getting a 
          job doing front-end web development. Several strangers on the internet said it was the easiest job to get into without a 
          formal education. Whether or not this is true, I made it my goal nevertheless. Now that I feel ready to start looking for 
          my first job, I'm encountering a bit of an existential crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, since I was fifteen or so my main pursuit in life has been to write, and I've devoted myself to studying the humanities. 
          And, in fact, that is still the primary interest of my life. Unfortunately, for me, this pursuit has provided little in 
          resemblance of a living wage. I tried teaching, but after discovering that teaching in schools these days has little to do 
          with education, I had to change course. I don't even remember what confluence of sources brought me to decide to try coding, 
          but I found building algorithms to be a satisfying exercise for the logical area of my mind. "I could do this for a living," 
          I thought. Thus, I'm now trying to make a living with coding while still chasing after my dream of writing books.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, so good. But as I'm close to believing (perhaps foolishly) that I'm ready to begin working, I've gotten worried about 
          actually getting a job. Is this what I really want to do? What am I sacrificing my time and energy to? I was worried that once 
          I got a job, all my time and energy would go to working on code that ultimately served no purpose. I envisioned maintaining 
          websites for companies selling useless gizmos that only increased the size of the mountains of garbage we've created as a 
          species, or further turned our civilization into fetish-clutching consumers. I was ready to call the whole thing off after 
          nearly a year of work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily my dread was short-lived, and after a bit of reflection I realized that programming could also contribute to improving 
          our civilization's relationship with the environment. In particular I could help companies and organizations that are working 
          on clean energy. As a front-end developer I could at least maintain their websites. It also showed me a way forward in how to 
          grow as a developer -- to help steer technology towards limiting the impact of human civilization on the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps it's an idealistic stance to take. There's certainly a fundamental contradiction in our economy's need for extracting 
          material from the earth that is disposable (so that it can be resold), but I maintain hope that technology can still be 
          developed towards more ecological ends. Indeed, it seems with the extreme changes in weather and climate that such a decision 
          is being made for us. We're being forced out of our state of inertia.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I'm looking for front-end development work with a company or organization that is working on something like renewable 
          energy or in improving environmental policy. And while my skillset is primarily web development, I'm also interested in 
          branching out to other areas of software development. If you have any leads in this area or would like to hire me on, please 
          contact me... I would also appreciate any advice...

        <p>
          I've been learning to code since May 2022. I decided to start keeping a blog about my journey into web development 
          and programming in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to help companies and organizations that are working toward changing our civilization's relationship with
          the environment. My current skillset is in front-end web development, which I
          While my immediate goal is to get a job as a front-end web developer, I want to keep pursuing programming and
           computer science
          to see where it will get me. I'm also interested in game development, artificical intelligence and machine learning, amd quantum
          computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admittedly though, computers and programming, while fascinating, are not my major passions. I've always wanted to be a writer
          first and foremost, and I spent most of my free-time writing or reading canonical literary works so that I can hopefully one day
          push the forms of imaginative literature.
